# GNOME-Hacks
**Note: This is not affiliated with GNOME**
This is an application that would allow planning e.g. hackathons or meetings for GNOME. (And it allows me to learn Django)

## Setup
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
